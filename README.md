### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name's HexHexByte and this is sort of my intro-journal-diary hybrid thingy.

01/06/2022

I've created this account to mark the beginning of a possible new direction in my life. I'll be spending more of my free time to learn more about high frequency trading, quantitative software development and algorithmic trading. As I write this, my academic interests (subject to change) are mainly in high performance computing (big data, concurrency, parallel computing etc), derivatives market (futures and options), credit market (bonds) and macroeconomics.
